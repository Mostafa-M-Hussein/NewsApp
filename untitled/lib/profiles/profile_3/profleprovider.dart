Flutter templates can be used to kick-start a project with a variety of fully-functional screens and accompanying business logic. Flutter allows you to build beautiful apps on desktop, mobile, and web from a single codebase. So Flutter templates are not tied to any platform, they can be used with iOS, Android or web as desired."),
